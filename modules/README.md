# üöÄ Custom Modules

This directory contains custom modules used in the project, which can also be utilized independently.

The true power of **Nix** lies in its modular system. Here, I've defined independent modules that can be imported or customized based on the exposed options.

### üîó Referencing Local Modules in Flake Parts

To reference a local module within your **flake-parts** setup, use the following syntax:

```nix
self.homeManagerModules.<module-name>
```

Simply replace `<module-name>` with the desired module name.

### üìö Available Modules

- **`homeManagerModules`**:
  Modules compatible with **Home Manager**, designed to work across various OS-based host machines.
  If you like any element of my system then use the respective module.

- **`nixosModules`**:
  Modules specifically tailored for **NixOS**, leveraging NixOS-specific features and functionality.
  If you are advanced user then use this as this configures the Operating system at it's core.
  Expects `input, impermanence` as module arg. (disable them if you don't want to use them but import them.)

- **`flakeModules`**:
  You can distribute reusable module logic through flakes using flake attributes, and that includes flakeModules.
  However, importing from self is not possible, because such an import could affect the self attribute set.
  To use your own exported module, you have to reference it directly.
  See https://flake.parts/dogfood-a-reusable-module.html

### üõ†Ô∏è Why Use These Modules?

- **Modular Design**: Import and tweak as needed for flexibility.
- **Independent Functionality**: Each module can work standalone or as part of a larger system.
